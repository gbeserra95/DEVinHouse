            "Long before Jim Halpert actor became known for directing the films A Quiet Place, John Krasinski directed the opening of The Office. Creating the iconic opening wasn't the intention, in fact: he went to Scranton, Pennsylvania, to research the paper, interviewing several employees of paper companies to get a better sense of the daily life. During the trip with some friends, Krasinski recorded several scenes around town, and this material ended up being used for the opening credits of the program."

            "Ainda que tenha uma enorme lista de participações especiais, não são tantos atores de The Office que conquistaram vagas no MCU depois. Na verdade, foram apenas 4. Evan Peters, o Mercúrio/Ralph Bonner de WandaVision, apareceu como sobrinho de Michael Scott em um episódio; Idris Elba, o Heimdall dos filmes do Thor, interpretou o executivo Charles Miner por alguns episódios. Já James Spader, que viveu o chefe Robert California, é o responsável por dar voz ao robô Ultron em Vingadores: A Era de Ultron. Por fim, Randall Park - o Jimmy Woo de WandaVision - teve uma breve e memorável aparição como o Jim asiático em uma pegadinha com Dwight."

According to the Office Ladies podcast (by actresses Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey), the reason is simple: the editors and writers of the series did the same, playing games during office hours. So they just took the opportunity to manifest the addiction within the series, adapting the real-life situation."

            "Actor behind one of the series' best characters, Steve Carell hasn't been fired - but that doesn't mean he's done well. At the time, the president of the NBC network did not really understand the success of the series, and he was not keen on renewing the actor's contract. To try to gain an advantage in a negotiation, Carell announced that he was going to leave the series, but did not hear any response from the channel nor a counterproposal (even if he was willing to accept). As a result, he left the show in 2011 grudgingly, leaving the rest of the cast and crew saddened by his departure."

The roster also includes Bob Odenkirk (the Saul Goodman of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul) for Michael Scott, Adam Scott (Parks and Recreation) for Jim, and Patton Oswalt (Ratatouille) for Dwight. All these tests were released on the official channel of the series, and serve both to imagine an alternate reality and to prove the perfect choices of the cast of the series."
